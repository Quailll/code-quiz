I got very overwhelmed trying to understand everything I was learning. I watched a lot of videos and did a lot of reading, but for some reason I just couldn't understand where to start on this project. I didn't want to copy what the main had or the video that Jeff made, but I will keep on working on this project till it is done. I just felt extremely overwhelmed and just kept getting stumped.
